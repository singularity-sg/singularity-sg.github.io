This year is my 14th year working with software. I remember starting out as a green eyed System Analyst working for a Singaporean GLC that had all the trappings of the cultural working style that local companies are known for, a sort of blunt, uninspiring efficiency that demands an industrious and templated style to software development. It was also organised in a way that would seemed perfectly logical in any other industry - it was organised into different teams for vertical industries or projects e.g. Legal, Trade & Logistics, etc.. and of course there were also teams for QA, Infra, DBAs etc. Software deployments were always laborious affairs, with forms to fill, QA to approve and pointless tasks that nobody questioned. There were many smart people in that company but somehow, the organisation culture prevented people from questioning many ineffective processes that couldn't help produce better software for our customers. I moved on from that after 3.5 years and a nagging sense that software development methods could be better. A few more years in a semiconductor company provided my with a job but nothing inspiring in terms of good software development practices. My third job, however, was a very refreshing change in terms of software development methods. 

This company uses a really interesting Agile Methodology called XP that was rarely heard about and used at that time around 2009. As a matter of fact, they were using XP for many years and they were actually practising Agile in a manner that makes sense for me. Some Agile practices like pairing, TDD and Continuous Development/Integration were actually running and working in the company. Indeed, working here influenced deeply some of the ideas that I will put forth in what I think is an ideal and practical working environment for Software Development. Unfortunately, despite the good things that happened in WDS, it was later acquired by Xerox and as all acquisitions go, there was bound to be a reorganisation and some senior management out there decided to close the Singapore office.

This brings me to my current job, which has a rather different way of working, with an attempt at running the whole team in an async manner, which sort of adopts practices in the [Async Manifesto](http://asyncmanifesto.org). It is markedly different from my time in WDS where agile values were held observed like they were biblical commandments.

Thus, having seen all the different mixes of styles and culture in a software development environment, I think I am qualified to put forth some proposals on how an effective software development team should be structured. I will not only talk about team structure, working methodologies, practices but also on the working environment itself, like how spaces should be setup and what tools could be used to accomodate different styles and maximise the productivity and happiness of this curious breed of software craftsmen.

### Team structure
A software team should be organised in a way to meet the business goals in the most efficient and productive way possible. But how do we determine what is the most efficient or productive way? By distilling everything to its essence, we can say that the most productive team is one where everyone knows what to work on and has the maximal time available to spend on developing products or services that achieves the business goals. In a perfectly telepathic team, everyone is also able to understand what everyone else is doing and how that work fits into the larger picture. However, all this is impossible to achieve without some kind of communication and coordination amongst members of the team. Therefore, a good team structure is one that allows the team to be able to have frictionless communications. However, in order to disseminate information within the team effectively, the team size cannot be too big. I think, generally, a team size of 7-8 would be ideal as it is big enough to tackle problems that are large while still allowing communications to flow easily. Agile practices like standups or retrospectives are also easily conducted at this size. This team should be a cross-functional team that is in charge of a business goal and could comprise of not just software developers but also product owners, UX designers, infrastructure/devops members.

The team should be made wholly responsible for projects and there should not be a notion of developers vs designers or product owners. A cross functional team like this allows any problem to be approached by any member of a team and also cross pollination of ideas instead of a notion of software issues/ ux issues etc.

### Working Environment / Space
An ideal working space that caters to all working styles will typically have the following:
- open hotdesking spaces that are good for large team collaborations.
- pairing stations/cubicles that are suitable for pairing work 
- personal cubicles with privacy for other kinds of solo work or for activities requiring quiet/privacy
